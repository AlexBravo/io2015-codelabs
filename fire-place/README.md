Getting Started
---------------

*Full instructions will be released after Google I/O 2015.*

In Android Studio, use the "Import non-Android Studio project" or 
"Import Project" option. If prompted for a gradle configuration
accept the default settings. 

Alternatively use the `./gradlew build` command to build the project directly.

Don't forget to add your API key to the AndroidManifest.xml
(See https://developers.google.com/places/android/signup) and to add your
Firebase URL to MapsActivity.java.
